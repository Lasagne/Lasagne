- **If you have a question or need help using Lasagne**, please post on [our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lasagne-users) instead of creating an issue. Make sure to check the [Lasagne documentation](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and the [Theano documentation](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) first! You can search the mailing list as well to see if your question has come up before.

- **If you would like to report a bug**, feel free to open an issue. Please verify first that the problem is not in your own code by reviewing the documentation. If you are able to provide a minimal code example that reproduces the bug, this will greatly speed up the process of tracking down the problem.

- **If you would like to contribute**, feel free to open a pull request. Please review our documentation on [what to contribute](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/development.html#what-to-contribute) and [how to contribute](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/development.html#how-to-contribute). Some contributions may be better suited for our [Recipes repository](https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes), where we collect examples, tutorials, trained models, utilities and paper reimplementations.
