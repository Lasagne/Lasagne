Lasagne is a work in progress, input is welcome. The available documentation is
limited for now. The project is at `GitHub`_.

instructions for setting up Lasagne, then walks step-by-step through an example
of using Lasagne to classify MNIST digits. Finally, there are some hints for
new Lasagne developers what to install and where to start.
