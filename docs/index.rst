Welcome to Lasagne
==================

Lasagne is a lightweight library to build and train neural networks in Theano.

Lasagne is a work in progress, input is welcome. The available documentation is
limited for now. The project is at `GitHub`_.

User's Guide

This part of the documentation is mostly prose.  It starts with installation
instructions for setting up Lasagne, then walks step-by-step through an example
of using Lasagne to classify MNIST digits. Finally, there are some hints for
new Lasagne developers what to install and where to start.
