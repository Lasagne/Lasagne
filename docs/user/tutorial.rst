Run the MNIST example
=====================

In this first part of the tutorial, we will run the MNIST example
that's included in the source distribution of Lasagne.

It is assumed that you have already run through the
:ref:`installation`.  If you haven't done so already, get a copy of
the source tree of Lasagne.  It should include a number of examples in
the ``examples`` folder.  Navigate to the folder and list its
contents:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd examples
  ls

Now run the ``mnist.py`` example:

.. code-block:: bash

  python mnist.py
