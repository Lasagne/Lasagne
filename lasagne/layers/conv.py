    This function computes the length along a single axis, which corresponds
    to a 1D convolution. It can also be used for convolutions with higher
    dimensionalities by using it individually for each axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_length : int or None
        The size of the input.

    filter_size : int
        The size of the filter.

    stride : int
        The stride of the convolution operation.

    pad : int, 'full' or 'same' (default: 0)
        By default, the convolution is only computed where the input and the
        filter fully overlap (a valid convolution). When ``stride=1``, this
        yields an output that is smaller than the input by ``filter_size - 1``.
        The `pad` argument allows you to implicitly pad the input with zeros,
        extending the output size.

        A single integer results in symmetric zero-padding of the given size on
        both borders.

        ``'full'`` pads with one less than the filter size on both sides. This
        is equivalent to computing the convolution wherever the input and the
        filter overlap by at least one position.

        ``'same'`` pads with half the filter size on both sides (one less on
        the second side for an even filter size). When ``stride=1``, this
        results in an output size equal to the input size.

    Returns
    -------
    int or None
        The output size corresponding to the given convolution parameters, or
        ``None`` if `input_size` is ``None``.

    Convolutional layer base class

    Base class for performing an `n`-dimensional convolution on its input,
    optionally adding a bias and applying an elementwise nonlinearity. Note
    that this class cannot be used in a Lasagne network, only its subclasses
    can (e.g., :class:`Conv1DLayer`, :class:`Conv2DLayer`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming : a :class:`Layer` instance or a tuple
        The layer feeding into this layer, or the expected input shape. Must
        be a tensor of 2+`n` dimensions:
        ``(batch_size, num_input_channels, <n spatial dimensions>)``.

    num_filters : int
        The number of learnable convolutional filters this layer has.

    filter_size : int or iterable of int
        An integer or an `n`-element tuple specifying the size of the filters.

    stride : int or iterable of int
        An integer or an `n`-element tuple specifying the stride of the
        convolution operation.

    pad : int, iterable of int, 'full', 'same' or 'valid' (default: 0)
        By default, the convolution is only computed where the input and the
        filter fully overlap (a valid convolution). When ``stride=1``, this
        yields an output that is smaller than the input by ``filter_size - 1``.
        The `pad` argument allows you to implicitly pad the input with zeros,
        extending the output size.

        A single integer results in symmetric zero-padding of the given size on
        all borders, a tuple of `n` integers allows different symmetric padding
        per dimension.

        ``'full'`` pads with one less than the filter size on both sides. This
        is equivalent to computing the convolution wherever the input and the
        filter overlap by at least one position.

        ``'same'`` pads with half the filter size (rounded down) on both sides.
        When ``stride=1`` this results in an output size equal to the input
        size. Even filter size is not supported.

        ``'valid'`` is an alias for ``0`` (no padding / a valid convolution).

        Note that ``'full'`` and ``'same'`` can be faster than equivalent
        integer values due to optimizations by Theano.

    untie_biases : bool (default: False)
        If ``False``, the layer will have a bias parameter for each channel,
        which is shared across all positions in this channel. As a result, the
        `b` attribute will be a vector (1D).

        If ``True``, the layer will have separate bias parameters for each
        position in each channel. As a result, the `b` attribute will be an
        `n`-dimensional tensor.

    W : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array or callable
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the weights.
        These should be a tensor of 2+`n` dimensions with shape
        ``(num_filters, num_input_channels, <n spatial dimensions>)``.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    b : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array, callable or ``None``
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the biases. If set to
        ``None``, the layer will have no biases. Otherwise, biases should be
        a 1D array with shape ``(num_filters,)`` if `untied_biases` is set to
        ``False``. If it is set to ``True``, its shape should be
        ``(num_filters, <n spatial dimensions>)`` instead.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    nonlinearity : callable or None
        The nonlinearity that is applied to the layer activations. If None
        is provided, the layer will be linear.

    flip_filters : bool (default: True)
        Whether to flip the filters before sliding them over the input,
        performing a convolution (this is the default), or not to flip them and
        perform a correlation. Note that for some other convolutional layers in
        Lasagne, flipping incurs an overhead and is disabled by default --
        check the documentation when using learned weights from another layer.

    n : int or None
        The dimensionality of the convolution (i.e., the number of spatial
        dimensions of each feature map and each convolutional filter). If
        ``None``, will be inferred from the input shape.

    **kwargs
        Any additional keyword arguments are passed to the `Layer` superclass.

    Attributes
    ----------
    W : Theano shared variable or expression
        Variable or expression representing the filter weights.

    b : Theano shared variable or expression
        Variable or expression representing the biases.

    pad : int, iterable of int, 'full', 'same' or 'valid' (default: 0)
        By default, the convolution is only computed where the input and the
        filter fully overlap (a valid convolution). When ``stride=1``, this
        yields an output that is smaller than the input by ``filter_size - 1``.
        The `pad` argument allows you to implicitly pad the input with zeros,
        extending the output size.

        A single integer results in symmetric zero-padding of the given size on
        all borders, a tuple of two integers allows different symmetric padding
        per dimension.

        ``'full'`` pads with one less than the filter size on both sides. This
        is equivalent to computing the convolution wherever the input and the
        filter overlap by at least one position.

        ``'same'`` pads with half the filter size (rounded down) on both sides.
        When ``stride=1`` this results in an output size equal to the input
        size. Even filter size is not supported.

        ``'valid'`` is an alias for ``0`` (no padding / a valid convolution).

        Note that ``'full'`` and ``'same'`` can be faster than equivalent
        integer values due to optimizations by Theano.

    untie_biases : bool (default: False)
        If ``False``, the layer will have a bias parameter for each channel,
        which is shared across all positions in this channel. As a result, the
        `b` attribute will be a vector (1D).

        If True, the layer will have separate bias parameters for each
        position in each channel. As a result, the `b` attribute will be a
        3D tensor.

    W : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array or callable
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the weights.
        These should be a 4D tensor with shape
        ``(num_filters, num_input_channels, filter_rows, filter_columns)``.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    b : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array, callable or ``None``
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the biases. If set to
        ``None``, the layer will have no biases. Otherwise, biases should be
        a 1D array with shape ``(num_filters,)`` if `untied_biases` is set to
        ``False``. If it is set to ``True``, its shape should be
        ``(num_filters, output_rows, output_columns)`` instead.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    nonlinearity : callable or None
        The nonlinearity that is applied to the layer activations. If None
        is provided, the layer will be linear.

    flip_filters : bool (default: True)
        Whether to flip the filters before sliding them over the input,
        performing a convolution (this is the default), or not to flip them and
        perform a correlation. Note that for some other convolutional layers in
        Lasagne, flipping incurs an overhead and is disabled by default --
        check the documentation when using learned weights from another layer.

    convolution : callable
        The convolution implementation to use. Usually it should be fine to
        leave this at the default value.

    **kwargs
        Any additional keyword arguments are passed to the `Layer` superclass.

    Transposed convolution layer base class

    Performs the backward pass of a n-dimensional convolution (also called
    transposed convolution, fractionally-strided convolution or deconvolution
    in the literature) on its input and optionally adds a bias and applies an
    elementwise nonlinearity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming : a :class:`Layer` instance or a tuple
        The layer feeding into this layer, or the expected input shape. The
        output of this layer should be a 4D tensor, with shape
        ``(batch_size, num_input_channels, input_rows, input_columns)``.

    num_filters : int
        The number of learnable convolutional filters this layer has.

    filter_size : int or iterable of int
        An integer or a n-element tuple specifying the size of the filters.

    stride : int or iterable of int
        An integer or a n-element tuple specifying the stride of the
        transposed convolution operation. For the transposed convolution, this
        gives the dilation factor for the input -- increasing it increases the
        output size.

    crop : int, iterable of int, 'full', 'same' or 'valid' (default: 0)
        By default, the transposed convolution is computed where the input and
        the filter overlap by at least one position (a full convolution). When
        ``stride=1``, this yields an output that is larger than the input by
        ``filter_size - 1``. It can be thought of as a valid convolution padded
        with zeros. The `crop` argument allows you to decrease the amount of
        this zero-padding, reducing the output size. It is the counterpart to
        the `pad` argument in a non-transposed convolution.

        A single integer results in symmetric cropping of the given size on all
        borders, a tuple of two integers allows different symmetric cropping
        per dimension.

        ``'full'`` disables zero-padding. It is is equivalent to computing the
        convolution wherever the input and the filter fully overlap.

        ``'same'`` pads with half the filter size (rounded down) on both sides.
        When ``stride=1`` this results in an output size equal to the input
        size. Even filter size is not supported.

        ``'valid'`` is an alias for ``0`` (no cropping / a full convolution).

        Note that ``'full'`` and ``'same'`` can be faster than equivalent
        integer values due to optimizations by Theano.

    untie_biases : bool (default: False)
        If ``False``, the layer will have a bias parameter for each channel,
        which is shared across all positions in this channel. As a result, the
        `b` attribute will be a vector (1D).

        If True, the layer will have separate bias parameters for each
        position in each channel. As a result, the `b` attribute will be a
        3D tensor.

    W : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array or callable
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the weights.
        These should be a 4D tensor with shape
        ``(num_input_channels, num_filters, filter_rows, filter_columns)``.
        Note that the first two dimensions are swapped compared to a
        non-transposed convolution.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    b : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array, callable or ``None``
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the biases. If set to
        ``None``, the layer will have no biases. Otherwise, biases should be
        a 1D array with shape ``(num_filters,)`` if `untied_biases` is set to
        ``False``. If it is set to ``True``, its shape should be
        ``(num_filters, output_rows, output_columns)`` instead.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    nonlinearity : callable or None
        The nonlinearity that is applied to the layer activations. If None
        is provided, the layer will be linear.

    flip_filters : bool (default: False)
        Whether to flip the filters before sliding them over the input,
        performing a convolution, or not to flip them and perform a
        correlation (this is the default). Note that this flag is inverted
        compared to a non-transposed convolution.

    output_size : int or iterable of int or symbolic tuple of ints
        The output size of the transposed convolution. Allows to specify
        which of the possible output shapes to return when stride > 1.
        If not specified, the smallest shape will be returned.

    n : int or None
        The dimensionality of the transposed convolution (i.e., the number of
        spatial dimensions of each feature map and each convolutional filter).
        If ``None``, will be inferred from the input shape.

    **kwargs
        Any additional keyword arguments are passed to the `Layer` superclass.

    Attributes
    ----------
    W : Theano shared variable or expression
        Variable or expression representing the filter weights.

    b : Theano shared variable or expression
        Variable or expression representing the biases.

    Notes
    -----
    The transposed convolution is implemented as the backward pass of a
    corresponding non-transposed convolution. It can be thought of as dilating
    the input (by adding ``stride - 1`` zeros between adjacent input elements),
    padding it with ``filter_size - 1 - crop`` zeros, and cross-correlating it
    with the filters. See [1]_ for more background.

    Performs the backward pass of a 1D convolution (also called transposed
    convolution, fractionally-strided convolution or deconvolution in the
    literature) on its input and optionally adds a bias and applies an
    elementwise nonlinearity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming : a :class:`Layer` instance or a tuple
        The layer feeding into this layer, or the expected input shape. The
        output of this layer should be a 4D tensor, with shape
        ``(batch_size, num_input_channels, input_rows, input_columns)``.

    num_filters : int
        The number of learnable convolutional filters this layer has.

    filter_size : int
        An integer specifying the size of the filters.

    stride : int
        An integer specifying the stride of the
        transposed convolution operation. For the transposed convolution, this
        gives the dilation factor for the input -- increasing it increases the
        output size.

    crop : int, iterable of int, 'full', 'same' or 'valid' (default: 0)
        By default, the transposed convolution is computed where the input and
        the filter overlap by at least one position (a full convolution). When
        ``stride=1``, this yields an output that is larger than the input by
        ``filter_size - 1``. It can be thought of as a valid convolution padded
        with zeros. The `crop` argument allows you to decrease the amount of
        this zero-padding, reducing the output size. It is the counterpart to
        the `pad` argument in a non-transposed convolution.

        A single integer results in symmetric cropping of the given size on all
        borders, a tuple of two integers allows different symmetric cropping
        per dimension.

        ``'full'`` disables zero-padding. It is is equivalent to computing the
        convolution wherever the input and the filter fully overlap.

        ``'same'`` pads with half the filter size (rounded down) on both sides.
        When ``stride=1`` this results in an output size equal to the input
        size. Even filter size is not supported.

        ``'valid'`` is an alias for ``0`` (no cropping / a full convolution).

        Note that ``'full'`` and ``'same'`` can be faster than equivalent
        integer values due to optimizations by Theano.

    untie_biases : bool (default: False)
        If ``False``, the layer will have a bias parameter for each channel,
        which is shared across all positions in this channel. As a result, the
        `b` attribute will be a vector (1D).

        If True, the layer will have separate bias parameters for each
        position in each channel. As a result, the `b` attribute will be a
        3D tensor.

    W : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array or callable
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the weights.
        These should be a 4D tensor with shape
        ``(num_input_channels, num_filters, filter_rows, filter_columns)``.
        Note that the first two dimensions are swapped compared to a
        non-transposed convolution.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    b : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array, callable or ``None``
        Initial value, expression or initializer for the biases. If set to
        ``None``, the layer will have no biases. Otherwise, biases should be
        a 1D array with shape ``(num_filters,)`` if `untied_biases` is set to
        ``False``. If it is set to ``True``, its shape should be
        ``(num_filters, output_rows, output_columns)`` instead.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    nonlinearity : callable or None
        The nonlinearity that is applied to the layer activations. If None
        is provided, the layer will be linear.

    flip_filters : bool (default: False)
        Whether to flip the filters before sliding them over the input,
        performing a convolution, or not to flip them and perform a
        correlation (this is the default). Note that this flag is inverted
        compared to a non-transposed convolution.

    output_size : int or iterable of int or symbolic tuple of ints
        The output size of the transposed convolution. Allows to specify
        which of the possible output shapes to return when stride > 1.
        If not specified, the smallest shape will be returned.

    **kwargs
        Any additional keyword arguments are passed to the `Layer` superclass.

    Attributes
    ----------
    W : Theano shared variable or expression
        Variable or expression representing the filter weights.

    b : Theano shared variable or expression
        Variable or expression representing the biases.

        An integer or a 2-element tuple specifying the size of the filters.

    dilation : int or iterable of int
        An integer or a 2-element tuple specifying the dilation factor of the

        inserted between adjacent filter elements.

        The amount of implicit zero padding of the input.

    untie_biases : bool (default: False)
        If ``False``, the layer will have a bias parameter for each channel,
        which is shared across all positions in this channel. As a result, the
        `b` attribute will be a vector (1D).

        If True, the layer will have separate bias parameters for each
        position in each channel. As a result, the `b` attribute will be a
        3D tensor.

    W : Theano shared variable, expression, numpy array or callable

        ``False``. If it is set to ``True``, its shape should be
        ``(num_filters, output_rows, output_columns)`` instead.
        See :func:`lasagne.utils.create_param` for more information.

    nonlinearity : callable or None
        The nonlinearity that is applied to the layer activations. If None
        is provided, the layer will be linear.

        performing a convolution, or not to flip them and perform a
        correlation (this is the default).
        This implementation does not support flipped filters, the argument is
        provided for compatibility to other convolutional layers only.

    **kwargs
        Any additional keyword arguments are passed to the `Layer` superclass.

    Notes
    -----
    The dilated convolution is implemented as the backward pass of a
    convolution wrt. weights, passing the filters as the output gradient.
    It can be thought of as dilating the filters (by adding ``dilation - 1``
    zeros between adjacent filter elements) and cross-correlating them with the
    input. See [1]_ for more background.
