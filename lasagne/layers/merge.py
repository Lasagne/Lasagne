def autocrop(inputs, cropping):
    """
    Crops the given input arrays.

    Cropping takes a sequence of inputs and crops them per-axis in order to
    ensure that their sizes are consistent so that they can be combined
    in an element-wise fashion. If cropping is enabled for a specific axis,
    the minimum size in that axis of all inputs is computed, and all
    inputs are cropped to that size.

    The per-axis cropping modes are:

    `None`: this axis is not cropped, inputs are unchanged in this axis

    `'lower'`: inputs are cropped choosing the lower portion in this axis
    (`a[:crop_size, ...]`)

    `'upper'`: inputs are cropped choosing the upper portion in this axis
    (`a[-crop_size:, ...]`)

    `'center'`: inputs are cropped choosing the central portion in this axis
    (``a[offset:offset+crop_size, ...]`` where
    ``offset = (a.shape[0]-crop_size)//2)``

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : list of Theano expressions
        The input arrays in the form of a list of Theano expressions

    cropping : list of cropping modes
        Cropping modes, one for each axis. If length of `cropping` is less
        than the number of axes in the inputs, it is padded with `None`.
        If `cropping` is None, `input` is returned as is.

    Returns
    -------
    list of Theano expressions
        each expression is the cropped version of the corresponding input

    Example
    -------
    For example, given three inputs:

    >>> import numpy
    >>> import theano

    >>> a = numpy.random.random((1, 2, 3, 4))
    >>> b = numpy.random.random((5, 4, 4, 2))
    >>> c = numpy.random.random((7, 1, 8, 9))

    Cropping mode for each axis:

    >>> cropping = [None, 'lower', 'center', 'upper']

    Crop (note that the input arrays are converted to Theano vars first,
    and that the results are converted back from Theano expressions to
    numpy arrays by calling `eval()`)
    >>> xa, xb, xc = autocrop([theano.shared(a), \
                               theano.shared(b), \
                               theano.shared(c)], cropping)
    >>> xa, xb, xc = xa.eval(), xb.eval(), xc.eval()

    They will be left as is in axis 0 and cropped in the other three,
    choosing the lower, center and upper portions:

    Axis 0: choose all, axis 1: lower 1 element,
    axis 2: central 3 (all) and axis 3: upper 2
    >>> (xa == a[:, :1, :3, -2:]).all()
    True

    Axis 0: choose all, axis 1: lower 1 element,
    axis 2: central 3 starting at 0 and axis 3: upper 2 (all)
    >>> (xb == b[:, :1, :3, -2:]).all()
    True

    Axis 0: all, axis 1: lower 1 element (all),
    axis 2: central 3 starting at 2 and axis 3: upper 2
    >>> (xc == c[:, :1, 2:5:, -2:]).all()
