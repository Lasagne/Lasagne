    Cross-channel Local Response Normalization for 2D feature maps.

    Aggregation is purely across channels, not within channels,
    and performed "pixelwise".

    Input order is assumed to be `BC01`.

    If the value of the ith channel is :math:`x_i`, the output is

    .. math::

        x_i = \frac{x_i}{ (k + ( \alpha \sum_j x_j^2 ))^\beta }

    where the summation is performed over this position on :math:`n`
    neighboring channels.

    This code is adapted from pylearn2.
